title: "A Machine Learning Approach to Predict Advanced Malware"
collection: publications
excerpt: 'The pervasive usage of communication systems has created many different networks with huge connectivity options for entities and services on the Internet. The options have been powered with new computing technologies that have advanced existing malware and have created new malware more than ever. The new malware has extremely different properties and it uses many stealthy methods to hide its traces during an attack. Therefore, it is impossible to detect the new malware, which we called advanced malware, with existing anti-malware systems and prevent the attacks accordingly. In this paper, we extract distinctive features of advanced malware to predict the type of malware. We present a novel machine learning approach to predict the type of malware. We also experimentally analyze malware to show correlations among features that may be used to predict advanced malware. The analyses results show that correlations among the distinguishing properties will be used to predict the type of malware.'
